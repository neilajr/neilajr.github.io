title: Extract DuckDB UI Jupyter Notebook
date: 2025-06-01

I really like DuckDB, and since they've released a UI I _really_ _really_ like DuckDB. But presently there is not built-in way to export the Jupyter notebook to be used in another tool.

So [I made a gist](https://gist.github.com/neilajr/1629391f609a3b46afcaaa438b0797ee).

Hope it's useful.
